If there is one thing I have learned from working on developing interactive functionality in ePub3 for the last year, it‘s that every reader has it’s pros and cons: but most readers only pros are having fewer cons.

The most extensive ePub3 support is offered through Readium which is currently a Chrome plugin for reading ePub3 books. They are still building out their SDK on GitHub and working on the much anticipated Readium.js (which is still in early stages). However, let‘s be real: not many of us read books on our computers, much less in Google Chrome, and since Chrome doesn’t support plugins on mobile devices (yet) Readium is a bit useless right now.

So let's jump off the Readium ship whilst the SDK gets built out, and swim to one of the others. Unfortunately, most mobile reading apps have little or no support for ePub3 functionality. Native Android apps/devices like Kobo, Kindle (KF8), Aldiko, Gitden Reader, and even Google Play Books seem to stop interactivity at Anchor tags, and have no event.preventDefault() functionality to prevent obnoxious menus from popping up when a user taps something. The main issue with all of them seems to be lack of JavaScript support (seriously, we need to make a shirt about how all bad things lack JS support).
